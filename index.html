  <h1> International Income Inequality </h1>
  <p> Before we begin: imagine a very, very rich person in India. She's not the richest person in the country (who makes hundreds of millions each year, certainly), but she's close to the top of the national income distribution. If we were to split India into 20 groups according to income and line them up in a row, she would be the average member of the richest group.</p>

    <p> Now imagine a very, very poor person in the U.S. She's not the absolute poorest person in the country (who makes $0 a year) but she's close to the bottom of the national income distribution. If we were to split the U.S. into 20 groups according to income and line them up in a row, she would be the average member from the poorest group.</p>

    <p> The U.S. is a high-income country, and India is a middle-income country, so it's not surprising that the average person in the U.S. has a much higher income than the average person in India.</p>

    <p> But how do you think the very rich person from the U.S. compares to the very poor person from India?</p>
