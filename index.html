  <h1> International Income Inequality </h1>
  <p> Before we begin: imagine a very, very rich person in India. She's not the richest person in the country (who makes billions every year, certainly), but she's very, very rich. If we were to split India into 20 groups according to income and line them up in a row, she would be the average member of the richest group.</p>

    <p> Now imagine a very, very poor person in the U.S. She's not the absolute poorest person in the country (who makes $0 a year) but she's very, very poor. If we were to split the U.S. into 100 groups according to income and line them up in a row, she would be the average member from the poorest group.</p>

    <p> Here's the big question: how do you think these two people compare? (This will not be recorded; it's only for you to think about).</p>
