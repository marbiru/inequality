<h1> International Income Inequality </h1>

<div class="pure-g">

    <p> Before we begin: imagine a very, very rich person in India. She's not the richest person in the country (who gets hundreds of millions of dollars each year, certainly), but she's close to the top of the national income distribution. If we were to split India into 20 groups according to income and line them up in a row, she would be the average member of the richest group.</p>

    <p> Now imagine a very, very poor person in the U.S. She's not the absolute poorest person in the country (who makes $0 a year) but she's close to the bottom of the national income distribution. If we were to split the U.S. into 20 groups according to income and line them up in a row, she would be the average member from the poorest group.</p>

    <p> The U.S. is a high-income country, and India is a middle-income country, so it's not surprising that the average person in the U.S. has a much higher income than the average person in India.

  <div class="pure-u-1-3 pure-u-md-1-3">

    <p> The average person in the U.S. is just outside the top 10% of incomes in the world as a whole, whereas the average person in India is just above the bottom 20% of incomes in the world as a whole.</p>

    <p> But now we get to our big question. Remember the very rich person in India we talked about earlier, and the very poor person in the U.S.?
    <br />
    <br />
    How do you think <i>their</i> incomes compare? 
    <br />
    <br />
    Is the very rich person in India getting 10x more than the very poor person in the U.S. each year? 
    <br />
    <br />
    Or 100x more? 
    <br />
    <br />
    Or 1000x more?</p>

    <p class="caption">rough data, please consider as illustrative only</a></p>

    <p>It turns out that a very rich person in India (the average member of the top 5% of the Indian income distribution) is actually getting <b>less</b> than the average member of the bottom 5% of the U.S. income distribution.</p>

    <p> Now, I know what you're thinking: prices are different in India and the U.S. You can get a great cup of tea in Delhi for 15 US cents, and good luck doing that in Manhattan. But here's the thing: <b> the dataset used for these charts has <i>already</i> taken cost of living into account</b></p>

    <p> Of course, this isn't really a story about the U.S. and India; the same holds true if you compare many other high-income countries with other middle-income countries. So this is a story about how very, very rich some rich countries are, on a global scale: so rich that a poor person in a rich country can often be richer than a rich person in a middle-income country. I don't know about you but I found this very, very surprising.</p>
